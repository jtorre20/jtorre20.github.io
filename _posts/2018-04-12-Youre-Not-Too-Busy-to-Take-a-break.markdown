It might seem that your to-do list never ceases to grow. So much so, that you can't possibly find the time to stop your work even for 5 or 10 minutes for something as pointless as a break. Not so fast, though. It's important to not simply go about your day as usual, especially when you know theres a better way of doing something. Allocating time for breaks will in the long run make you happier, increase your focus, lead to better productivity and make you a better worker.  The alternative can have damaging effects on your productivity and mental state.

<h2>Reasons to Prioritize Breaks</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Breaks keep people from getting bored, distracted, tired, and unfocused.</li><br/>
    
    <p>As many people are aware and may have experienced , after an extended period of time working on a task or project, your brain may start to wander. This can be attributed to fatigue setting in. </p>
    
    <li>Working for too long can strain your muscles and lead to pain.</li><br/>
    
        <p>Not taking breaks can lead to higher stress, irritability, and long-term health risk such as depression, heart disease, and diabetes</p>
    
    <li>Humans are not biologically or physically wired to focus on one task for very long, and forcing it does not help.</li><br/>
    
        <p>When your brain gets tired, you will lose concentration, be less able to absorb information, and be less able to solve problems</p>
</ol>

<p>It's not just important to take a break, though. Mulitple studies have demonstrated that what you do during your break is just as important.</p>

<h2>When should you take a break?</h2>

<ul>
    <li>When you've worked for 90 minutes, consider taking a break of 15-20 minutes.</li>

</ul>

We've usually heard that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. However, the science is actually showing that a proper lunch, you know, not the kind with a tuna sandwich in one hand while you thrash the keyboard with the other, can have an outsized impact on your daily performance.

Up until recently, siestas were a traditional part of the Spanish culture. It was normal to even go home during your lunch hour and nap. If this was good enough for an entire country, who are we to question it.
