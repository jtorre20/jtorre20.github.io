As future web developers, our text editor can seem dear to us. It can even be easy to get a bit too attached to our beloved editors. However, no matter your editor of choice, its chief purpose is to boost your productivity. In order to do that I wanted to discuss a few extensions that we may want to consider using to calibrate our editors so that we get the most work done.

## 1. Prettier

    Prettier is a code formatter. It will try to standardize your
    coding style by removing all original styling and then reprints it,
    outputting a code that conforms to a consistent style. Prettier is compatible 
    and has support for various languages including Javascript (to include ES2017), CSS, 
    Typescript, and Markdown to name a few. Other languages are also in the works like Ruby and Python, for example.
