As future web developers, our text editor can seem dear to us. It can even be easy to get a bit too attached to our beloved editors. However, no matter your editor of choice, its chief purpose is to boost your productivity. In order to do that I wanted to discuss a few extensions that we may want to consider using to calibrate our editors so that we get the most work done.

# 1. Prettier

    Prettier is a code formatter. It will try to standardize your coding style by removing all original styling and then reprints it, outputting a code that conforms to a consistent style. Prettier is compatible and has support for various languages including Javascript (to include ES2017), CSS, Typescript, and Markdown to name a few. Other languages are also in the works like Ruby and Python, for example.

    <li>Breaks keep people from getting bored, distracted, tired, and unfocused.</li><br/>

    <p>As many people are aware and may have experienced , after an extended period of time working on a task or project, your brain may start to wander. This can be attributed to fatigue setting in. </p>

    <li>Working for too long can strain your muscles and lead to pain.</li><br/>
    
        <p>Not taking breaks can lead to higher stress, irritability, and long-term health risk such as depression, heart disease, and diabetes</p>
    
    <li>Humans are not biologically or physically wired to focus on one task for very long, and forcing it does not help.</li><br/>
    
        <p>When your brain gets tired, you will lose concentration, be less able to absorb information, and be less able to solve problems</p>
</ol>

<p>It's not just important to take a break, though. Mulitple studies have demonstrated that what you do during your break is just as important.</p>

<h2>When should you take a break?</h2>

<ul>
    <li>When you've worked for 90 minutes, consider taking a break of 15-20 minutes.</li>

</ul>

We've usually heard that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. However, the science is actually showing that a proper lunch, you know, not the kind with a tuna sandwich in one hand while you thrash the keyboard with the other, can have an outsized impact on your daily performance.

Up until recently, siestas were a traditional part of the Spanish culture. It was normal to even go home during your lunch hour and nap. If this was good enough for an entire country, who are we to question it.
